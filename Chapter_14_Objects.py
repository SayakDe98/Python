#input->process->output
#Object-Oriented 
# a program is made up of many cooperating objects
#instead of being the "whole program"- each object is a little "island"
# within the program and cooperatively  working with other objects.
#a program is made up of one or more objects working together -objects make use
#of each other's capabilities

# an object is a bit of self-containted code and data
# a key aspect of the object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable pars
# (divide and conquer)
# Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
# We have been using objects all along:String Objects, Integer Objects, Dictionary Object, List Objects...
 
#Objects get created and used
#Objects are bits of code and data

#Class-a template-Dog
#Method or Message-A defined capability of a class-bark()
#Field or attribute-A bit of data in a class-length
#Object or Instance -A particular instance of a class-Lassie

#Terminology:Class
#Defines the abstract characteristics of a thing(object), including the thing's characteristics
#(its attributes, fields or properties) and the thing's behaviours(the things it can do, or methods, operations
# or features).One might say that a class isa blueprint or factory that describes the nature of
#something.For example, the class Dog would consist of traits shared by all dogs,
#such as breed and fur color(characteristics), and the ability to bark and sit(behaviours).
